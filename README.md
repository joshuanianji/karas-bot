A proof of concept for simple discord bots.

Created using [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/configuration-files.html#implementing-your-config-file)

# RUN

I'll add more things here later, but you first want to install all node things by executing `npm install` in the terminal (first `cd` your way to the directory you have the code in). Make sure you have node and npm installed!

Running `node bot.js` will host the bot on your computer.
